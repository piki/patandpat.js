Come learn how to build casual games in JavaScript!  No programming or
JavaScript experience is required.  If you have a web browser, you have
all the tools you need to get started.  (And if you don't, how are you
reading this?)

The course will be nine sessions.  Each session will introduce both a new
game-development concept and a new JavaScript programming concept.  For
example, the first week, we will learn how to make a character run and
jump by calling JavaScript functions.

You don't have to attend all nine sessions, but you'll learn more if you
do.  We'll start from the beginning -- no programming experience required
-- and build a little more of our game and our programming knowledge each
week.

The mentors are Pat Brown of Hail Studio and Patrick Reynolds of GitHub.
